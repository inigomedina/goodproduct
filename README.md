# The Good Product
The official repository of The Good Product community at Slack.

You can enjoy the conversation at the [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/thegoodproduct/shared_invite/enQtMzk0NDMxODMyMjc4LWIxMjhmMDU0ZmE0NDc2YmRiMzQzMzU4NTBjYjk0NzI4Zjc3Yzc0MGU1ZDNmZGI2YWM0YWRhMDljYTc3NmFkZTc).

## Goal

We want to talk, learn, and discuss about any aspect related to products with no limit about types of products, topics, perspectives, or roles.

## Language

We use English as the primary language of the community. This allows us to bring people from practically any place of the world.

If this makes you feel unsure or shy, do not give too much importance to the language and use it in your own way. Let your voice be heard.

## Atmosphere

We seek for a community of eager learners, conscientious workers, and thoughtful, kind, supportive persons.
